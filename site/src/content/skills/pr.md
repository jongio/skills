## What it does

A concise checklist workflow for taking changes from local commit and preflight checks through PR submission, review resolution, CI monitoring, and merge.

Requires `test-doctor` and `doc-doctor`. PR preflight owns the documentation pass,
including when called by `go`, and reuses matching passing evidence.

## Use it
